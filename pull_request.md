# Suggesting changes and collaborating on a repo

GitHub makes it easy to collaborate with other Microsoft Learning users on the courses in which you are interested. 

You can modify your own copy of the lab materials, and then submit your changes to Microsoft Learning so that they can incorporate your updates. You might want to modify your lab materials if:

- You find a mistake in a lab. 

- The UI has changed since the lab was created. 

- You think that the lab needs improvements or modifications.

To modify lab materials, you should branch the repo, make updates in your branch, and then submit a pull request to the main (master) branch. This allows Microsoft Learning staff, and other MCTs and GitHub users to review, and comment on, your changes. 

You can review and comment on changes that other users make, and Microsoft Learning staff then approves and merges these changes into the master branch. This action notifies any user who is watching the repo that a change has occurred.

## Create a repo branch

1.	In Internet Explorer, navigate to the repo on GitHub.

1.	Click **Branch : branchname**, and then from the **Branches** list, select the branch you want to copy.

    > **Note**:	If there is only one branch, the **Branch** drop-down list shows **Branch: master**, and the only branch that is available is **master**.

3.	In the blank text box, type the name of the branch that you want to create.

4.	Click **Create branch: new branch name** when it appears.

After you have created a Branch, you can clone the files to your local repo, update them on your computer, and then check in the changes from the GitHub Desktop. If you are working with Markdown or other text files, you can edit them in GitHub, and then check in the changes online.
