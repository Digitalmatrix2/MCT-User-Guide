# Watching a repo

The simplest way to make sure you know about any changes to a repo is to watch it. You can do that, even if you do not clone a local copy of the repo.

To watch a repo, perform the following steps:

1.	In Internet Explorer, navigate to the repo on GitHub.

2.	Click **Watch**, and then under **Notifications**, select **Watching**.

To quit watching a repo, perform the following steps:

1.	In Internet Explorer, navigate to the repo on GitHub.

2.	Click **Watch**, and then under Notifications, select **Not watching**.

> **Note**: You can select the **Ignoring** option under the **Watch** drop-down list. However, this means that you receive no notifications, even if another user includes you in a discussion with the mention functionality and your GitHub user name. Therefore, you should be careful configuring the **Ignoring** option.
